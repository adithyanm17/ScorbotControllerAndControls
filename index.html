            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Scorbot E4 RU is a smart educational robot that can do many things. It works even better when it's connected to digital inputs. The digital signals to the controller when integrated with the controlling software, Scorbase, can move the robot to the pretrained positions. Let us jump into that.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="controller">
            <h2>Controller</h2>
            <p>The controller in Scorbot is like its brain and backbone combined. It's what makes everything work smoothly. This controller isn't just a passive part; it actively interacts with both analog and digital devices outside the robot. It takes orders from the Scorbase software, the control program for the robot, and turns them into real-world actions. Plus, it provides the power needed to make the robot move effectively. With analog and digital inputs, it can connect to various sensors and switches, giving Scorbot the ability to sense and respond to its surroundings. Whether it's picking up objects or avoiding obstacles, the controller ensures Scorbot operates accurately and reliably.</p>

        <section id="scorbase">
            <h2>Scorbase</h2>
            <p>Scorbase, the proprietary software accompanying Scorbot robotic arms, serves as the digital brain that drives their functionality. With Scorbase, users gain access to a comprehensive programming interface that simplifies the deployment and control of Scorbot manipulators. This software enables seamless integration of Scorbot into diverse workflows, offering tools for trajectory planning, task sequencing, and real-time monitoring.

        <section id="training">
            <h2>Training the Scorbot</h2>
            <p>Let's check out how we can teach or train the Scorbot its position. First, you need to open Scorbase, then go to file and select new project. Now you can see many options on the right side and a blank white box on the right side which is where you write your code. Before jumping directly into the code, let me explain some commands which we are going to use. As you can see, I selected an option called label. Label can be said as a function. Inside the label, we can write our instructions and conditions. Here you can see the If input box. With this, we can add conditions to our functions.</p>
            <p>Here I labelled MOVEMENT 1, put a WAIT condition, added an instruction, now I want to add or teach a position so that the robot could move to that position. Make sure you select online from the options on the menu bar before performing this, because only after that can you move your robot. Before starting training, press home on the menu bar. Now for setting positions, you can see just below the text editor, a box called manual movement in which you can see many buttons 1,2,3,Q,W,E..etc. Using that you can move the robot. After moving the robot, go to teach position, mark it as 1 or whatever you want and click on the blue robot symbol, to ensure the position you moved the robot is recorded.</p>

                <img src="7.png" alt="Scorbot Controller">
            </div>
            <p>Now you can use Go To Position to set target positions to move the robot. You can write your own code with these commands. After that, you can execute the program by clicking run &gt;&gt; single/continuous cycle. </p>
            <div class="single-image">
                <img src="16.png" alt="Scorbot Introduction Image">
            </div>
            <p>Here I will provide you with a code which I wrote to run my robot:</p>
            <pre><code>INPUTS:
If Input 1 Off Jump to MOV1
If Input 2 Off Jump to MOV2 
If Input 3 Off Jump to MOV3 
If Input 4 Off Jump to MOV4 
Jump to INPUTS
MOV1: 
Go to Position 1 Speed 10
Jump to INPUTS 
MOV2: 
Go to Position 2 Speed 10 
Jump to INPUTS 
MOV3: 
Go to Position 3 Speed 10 
Jump to INPUTS 
MOV4:
Go to Position 4 Speed 10 
Jump to INPUTS</code></pre>
            <p>The logic of this code is very simple. The code keeps checking if there are any inputs coming at the input pins. And whenever a digital input is entered into any of the digital input pins of the controller, the robot moves its arm to the targeted position. After executing the instruction, it will keep on checking. The jump-to condition after the if conditions makes a loop to monitor continuously. If it finds something, it jumps to the label named mov1 or others. Then back to the first label, which is input after executing it.</p>
            <p>Here is the movements which i trained my robot.</p>
